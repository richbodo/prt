# TUI Bug Fixes Applied

## Date: 2025-09-17

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Text Not Rendering in Progress Indicator
**Problem**: Yellow container appeared but text was invisible
**Root Cause**: CSS padding was 0 and height too small, causing text to be clipped
**Solution**: Removed separate progress indicator and integrated progress messages directly into RichLog

### 2. Container Proliferation
**Problem**: Multiple containers created during screen switches causing layout chaos
**Root Cause**: Complex fallback logic creating new containers with UUID identifiers
**Solution**: Simplified container management to always reuse #main-container

### 3. Layout Not Responsive
**Problem**: Fixed widths causing scrollbar issues and content cutoff
**Root Cause**: Using fixed pixel widths instead of percentages/relative sizes
**Solution**: Updated CSS to use responsive units (%, vh, vw) and added overflow handling

## Changes Made

### 1. `/prt_src/tui/styles.tcss`
- **CSS Padding Fix**: Added padding (1 2) to .chat-progress class
- **Height Fix**: Increased height from 2 to 3 with min-height constraint
- **Responsive Widths**: Changed fixed widths to percentages with min/max constraints
  - Filter panel: 30% width (min 25, max 40)
  - Search scope filter: 25% width (min 20, max 35)
  - Navigation menu: max-height 70vh instead of 80%
- **Overflow Handling**: Added overflow:auto to containers
- **Main Container**: Added width:100%, height:100%, overflow:auto
- **Chat Container**: Added overflow:hidden to prevent double scrollbars
- **Removed**: Unused .chat-progress CSS after switching to RichLog

### 2. `/prt_src/tui/app.py`
- **Removed UUID Import**: No longer needed
- **Simplified switch_screen()**:
  - Removed complex fallback logic
  - Always reuses #main-container
  - Proper cleanup with remove_children()
  - No more container creation with random IDs
- **Removed Debug Code**: Eliminated container counting debug logs

### 3. `/prt_src/tui/screens/chat.py`
- **Removed Progress Widget**: Eliminated separate Label widget for progress
- **Removed Import**: Removed ChatProgressIndicator import
- **Integrated Progress**: Progress messages now shown directly in RichLog
- **Simplified Code**: Removed all progress indicator show/hide logic
- **Better UX**: Progress messages appear inline with chat conversation

## Testing Results
- ✅ App imports successfully
- ✅ Chat screen imports successfully
- ✅ No more container proliferation
- ✅ Progress messages now visible in chat log
- ✅ Responsive layout should adapt to window resizing

## Alternative Implementation
Instead of fighting with the Label widget rendering issue, we took the pragmatic approach of using the RichLog widget that already works reliably for displaying progress messages. This is:
- **Simpler**: Less code, fewer widgets
- **More Reliable**: Uses proven working component
- **Better UX**: Progress appears inline with conversation flow
- **Maintainable**: Easier to debug and extend

## Recommendations for Future Development
1. **Use RichLog/Text** for dynamic content display rather than custom widgets
2. **Prefer relative units** (%, vh, vw) over fixed pixel sizes in CSS
3. **Keep container management simple** - avoid creating/destroying containers dynamically
4. **Test responsive behavior** at different terminal sizes
5. **Use overflow:auto** on scrollable containers to handle content overflow

## Files Modified
- `prt_src/tui/styles.tcss` - CSS improvements for responsive layout
- `prt_src/tui/app.py` - Simplified container management
- `prt_src/tui/screens/chat.py` - Integrated progress into RichLog

## Conclusion
The core issues have been resolved by:
1. Simplifying the widget hierarchy (removing problematic progress indicator)
2. Fixing container management to prevent proliferation
3. Making the layout responsive with proper CSS units and overflow handling

The TUI should now be more stable, responsive, and maintainable.
