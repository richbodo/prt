# DEPRECATED: Chat Integration Architecture

**Date Deprecated:** October 10, 2025
**Reason:** Over-engineered before validating basic tool calling works

This architecture attempted to build a complex multi-phase system with:
- Intent classification system (search, refine, select, export, view_details, error)
- Custom JSON command schema
- LLMDatabaseBridge abstraction layer
- Complex context management
- SearchSelectActWorkflow orchestration
- 125-169 hour implementation timeline

## Why It Was Deprecated

Following guidance from external LLM architecture best practices:
1. **Violated "10x rule"** - jumped to Phase 3 sophistication without validating Phase 1
2. **Added complexity speculatively** instead of based on metrics
3. **Over-engineered** - 7 phases when 3 would suffice
4. **Premature optimization** - built context management before basic queries work

## What We Learned

- Start with the absolute minimum (1 tool, simple prompt, basic orchestration)
- Let metrics drive architectural decisions
- Tool calling IS intent classification - don't build a separate intent system
- Validate each phase before adding complexity
- Progressive enhancement, not big design up front

## Replacement Architecture

See `docs/LLM_Integration/` for the simplified, evidence-based approach:
- Phase 1: Prove 1 tool works (6-8 hours)
- Phase 2: Add reliability and testing (16-20 hours)
- Phase 3: Expand only when metrics show need (16-24 hours)

Total: 44-60 hours vs. 125-169 hours, with working functionality in 2 weeks instead of months.
