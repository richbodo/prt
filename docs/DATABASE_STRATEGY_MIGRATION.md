# Database Strategy Migration: Moving Away from Encrypting DB Drivers

## Issue Overview (Issue #37)

The current PRT database encryption strategy using SQLAlchemy + pysqlcipher3 has significant reliability and maintenance issues that require a strategic change. This document outlines the problems and the migration plan to a more sustainable solution.

**ðŸŽ¯ FINAL DECISION (Issue #41 Complete)**: We have moved to **SQLAlchemy + Application-Level Encryption** using the `cryptography` library and OS keyrings. This provides better reliability, security, and maintainability than database-level encryption.

## Current Problems

### Issue #41: SQLAlchemy + pysqlcipher3 Compatibility Issues

**Problem**: The current implementation has known compatibility problems that make it unreliable for production use.

**Technical Issues**:
- `create_function` signature mismatch between SQLAlchemy and pysqlcipher3
- Complex event listener setup required for encryption
- Inconsistent behavior across different platforms
- Difficult debugging due to abstraction layers

**Code Example of Current Complexity**:
```python
# Current complex setup in encrypted_db.py
@event.listens_for(Engine, "connect")
def set_sqlcipher_pragma(dbapi_connection, connection_record):
    cursor = dbapi_connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute(f"PRAGMA key = '{self.encryption_key}'")
    cursor.execute("PRAGMA cipher_compatibility = 3")
    cursor.execute("PRAGMA page_size = 4096")
    cursor.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON")
    cursor.close()
```

**Impact**:
- Development time wasted on workarounds
- Unreliable behavior in production
- Difficult to maintain and debug
- Poor developer experience

### Issue #42: pysqlcipher3 Maintenance and Installation Problems

**Problem**: pysqlcipher3 is no longer actively maintained and has severe installation issues.

**Maintenance Issues**:
- Last release: 2021 (1.2.0) - over 3 years old
- Minimal recent activity from maintainer
- No binary packages available
- Requires compilation on all platforms

**Installation Problems**:
- Compilation failures on macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- Complex environment variable setup required
- Platform-specific workarounds needed
- No cross-platform installation support

**Installation Example**:
```bash
# Complex installation process
brew install sqlcipher
export CFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/sqlcipher/include/sqlcipher"
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/sqlcipher/lib"
pip install pysqlcipher3  # Often fails on macOS ARM64
```

**Impact**:
- Barrier to entry for new developers
- Inconsistent development environments
- Deployment complications
- Poor user experience

## Recommended Solution: Peewee + sqlcipher3

### Why Peewee + sqlcipher3?

**Advantages**:
1. **Same Maintainer**: Both projects maintained by Charles Leifer
2. **Native Integration**: Peewee has built-in support for sqlcipher3
3. **Active Development**: Both projects receive regular updates
4. **Better Documentation**: More comprehensive docs and examples
5. **Community Support**: Larger community due to Peewee's popularity
6. **Binary Packages**: Available as `sqlcipher3-binary` for Linux

**Technical Benefits**:
- Simpler, more readable code
- No compatibility issues
- Better performance
- Easier debugging
- Future-proof architecture

### Code Comparison

**Current SQLAlchemy + pysqlcipher3 (Complex)**:
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, event
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///my_app.db')
@event.listens_for(engine, "connect")
def set_sqlcipher_pragma(dbapi_connection, connection_record):
    cursor = dbapi_connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("PRAGMA key = 'my-secret-key'")
    cursor.execute("PRAGMA cipher_compatibility = 3")
    cursor.close()
```

**Proposed Peewee + sqlcipher3 (Simple)**:
```python
from peewee import *
from playhouse.sqlcipher_ext import SqlCipherDatabase

# Simple encrypted database setup
db = SqlCipherDatabase('my_app.db', passphrase='my-secret-key')

class User(Model):
    name = CharField()
    email = CharField()

    class Meta:
        database = db

# Usage
db.connect()
User.create(name='John', email='john@example.com')
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:

2. **Data Safety**: All data preserved during migration attempts
3. **Incremental Migration**: Can migrate components individually
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing at each phase

## Conclusion

The migration from SQLAlchemy + pysqlcipher3 to Peewee + sqlcipher3 addresses the core issues with the current database encryption strategy:

- âœ… **Eliminates compatibility issues**
- âœ… **Simplifies installation and maintenance**
- âœ… **Provides active, well-maintained dependencies**
- âœ… **Improves code quality and maintainability**
- âœ… **Future-proofs the architecture**

The migration effort is reasonable (2-3 weeks) and the long-term benefits significantly outweigh the short-term migration costs. This change will result in a more reliable, maintainable, and user-friendly database encryption solution.
