# PRT TUI Migration Plan
# Generated: 2025-08-29
# Purpose: Comprehensive plan to address Issues #68-72 via Textual, preparing for future Flet migration
# Status: Phase 1 COMPLETE ‚úÖ | Phase 2 READY

## Overview
This plan addresses the CLI UX issues (#68-72) by implementing Textual for improved TUI and web interface,
while architecting for future Flet mobile deployment.

## Key Architectural Decisions
1. Core operations MUST be UI-agnostic (enables Flet later)
2. Search uses SQLite FTS5 (fast, portable, works on mobile)
3. Autocomplete is centralized (one engine, multiple UIs)
4. Validation is in core layer (consistent across platforms)
5. Screens are thin (UI only, no business logic)

## Implementation Patterns (Established in Phase 1)
1. **Error handling with logging and fallbacks** - Never crash, always provide safe defaults
2. **Memory-bounded collections** - Implement MAX_SIZE limits for long-running stability
3. **Comprehensive test coverage** - Include error scenarios and edge cases
4. **Use existing search infrastructure** - Don't reinvent what Phase 1 built
5. **Logger usage instead of print** - Use `get_logger(__name__)` for all output
6. **Scale target: 5000+ contacts** - All components must handle this efficiently

## Status Markers
- [ ] Not Started
- [üîÑ] In Progress  
- [‚úÖ] Completed
- [‚ùå] Blocked
- [‚è≠Ô∏è] Skipped

## Phase Tracking

### Phase 0: Architecture Preparation
**Goal:** Separate business logic from UI for future platform portability

- [‚úÖ] Task 0.1: Create Core Operations Layer
  - Location: `prt_src/core/operations.py`
  - Extract business logic from CLI
  - Remove all Rich/console dependencies
  - Return data, not formatted output

- [‚úÖ] Task 0.2: Create Platform Abstraction Layer
  - Location: `prt_src/platforms/`
  - Create base classes for platform-specific code
  - Prepare for terminal/web/mobile variants

### Phase 1: Database & Search Infrastructure ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Build fast search and indexing for 5000+ contacts
**Parallelizable:** Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 can run simultaneously

- [‚úÖ] Task 1.1: Add FTS5 Virtual Tables [PARALLEL] - PR #73 (Merged)
  - Create migrations/add_fts5_support.sql
  - Add contacts_fts, notes_fts, tags_fts virtual tables
  - Add synchronization triggers
  - Update SchemaManager

- [‚úÖ] Task 1.2: Build Search Indexer [PARALLEL] - PR #74 (Merged)
  - Location: `prt_src/core/search_index/indexer.py`
  - Implement SearchIndexer class
  - Add incremental updates
  - Create result ranking

- [‚úÖ] Task 1.3: Create Contact Search Cache [PARALLEL] - PR #75 (Merged)
  - Location: `prt_src/core/search_cache/contact_cache.py`
  - Build LRU cache
  - Implement prefix trie for autocomplete
  - Add cache warming

- [‚úÖ] Task 1.4: Implement Unified Search API [DEPENDS: 1.1, 1.2] - PR #77
  - Location: `prt_src/core/search_unified.py`
  - Search across all entities
  - Group results by type
  - Add search suggestions

### Phase 2: Core Components Library
**Goal:** Build reusable components for Textual and future Flet
**Parallelizable:** All tasks can run simultaneously

#### Integration Guidelines:
- Components must be UI-framework agnostic (no Textual imports in core)
- Should integrate with existing search infrastructure where applicable
- Must handle 5000+ contacts efficiently
- Components can be aware of each other but loosely coupled

- [ ] Task 2.1: Create Autocomplete Engine [PARALLEL]
  - Location: `prt_src/core/components/autocomplete.py`
  - UI-agnostic autocomplete logic
  - Fuzzy matching (consider using existing SearchIndexer for scoring)
  - Context-aware suggestions based on:
    - Current entity type (contact/tag/note)
    - User search history (from UnifiedSearchAPI._search_history)
    - Popular searches (from UnifiedSearchAPI._popular_searches)
  - **Integration:** Should wrap/enhance existing ContactSearchCache.autocomplete()
  - **Example:** When typing "Joh", suggest "John Smith" if recently searched

- [ ] Task 2.2: Build Pagination System [PARALLEL]
  - Location: `prt_src/core/components/pagination.py`
  - Alphabetical jump (A-Z navigation for contact lists)
  - Position memory (remember last viewed page per list type)
  - Lazy loading (fetch pages on demand, not all 5000 at once)
  - **Integration:** Works with search results from UnifiedSearchAPI
  - **Example:** Jump to "S" section, remember user was on page 3 of "S" contacts
  - **Performance:** Must paginate 5000+ items smoothly

- [ ] Task 2.3: Create Selection System [PARALLEL]
  - Location: `prt_src/core/components/selection.py`
  - Multi-select logic (checkbox-style selection tracking)
  - Filter/sort capabilities:
    - By name (alphabetical)
    - By date added (newest/oldest)
    - By relationship count
    - By tag presence
  - Selection history (remember recent selections for quick re-select)
  - **Integration:** Maintains selection state across pagination changes
  - **Example:** Select 10 contacts, change page, selections persist

- [ ] Task 2.4: Build Validation System [PARALLEL]
  - Location: `prt_src/core/components/validation.py`
  - Entity validators:
    - Contact: email format, phone normalization, required fields
    - Tag: no special characters, max length
    - Note: title required, content max length
    - Relationship: prevent self-relationships, validate dates
  - Deduplication detection (find similar contacts by name/email/phone)
  - Data sanitization (strip whitespace, normalize phone numbers)
  - **Integration:** Used by all create/update operations in core
  - **Example:** Detect "John Smith" vs "john smith" as potential duplicate

### Phase 3: Textual UI Framework (Detailed Implementation)

## TDD Testing Strategy for Phase 3-4

### Widget Testing Pattern (Phase 3)
1. **Write failing test first** (`tests/test_tui_*.py`)
   - Test widget initialization
   - Test key handling and navigation
   - Test integration with Phase 2 components
   - Test state management
2. **Implement widget** to pass tests
3. **Add edge case tests** and fix issues
4. **Performance test** with 5000+ items

### Screen Testing Pattern (Phase 4)
1. **Write integration tests** (`tests/test_tui_*_screen.py`)
   - Test widget composition
   - Test screen transitions
   - Test data flow between widgets
   - Test keybinding conflicts
2. **Implement screen** using widgets
3. **Test user workflows** end-to-end

### What NOT to Test
- Visual rendering (user testing will cover)
- CSS styling
- Exact pixel positions
- Animation timing

### Critical Integration Tests
- "You" contact creation on first run
- Selection state persistence across pagination
- Export functionality with 100+ selected items
- Backup/restore with auto-backup creation
- Mode switching (NAV/EDIT) consistency

## Implementation Order (Updated)

### Phase 3 Implementation Sequence
1. Task 3.1 (App structure) - Sets up foundation
2. Task 3.2 (Base widgets) - Provides mode management
3. Tasks 3.3-3.8 in parallel - All widgets independent

### Phase 4 Implementation Sequence
1. Task 4.1 (Home) - Entry point
2. Tasks 4.2-4.7 can be done in any order (all screens independent)

## Critical Path
Minimum path to address Issues #68-72:
Phase 2 (Components) ‚Üí Phase 3.1-3.2 (Foundation) ‚Üí Phase 3.3-3.6 (Core Widgets) ‚Üí Phase 4.1-4.5 (Issue Screens)

## Parallelization Groups
**Group A (UI Components):**
- Tasks 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5

**Group B (Infrastructure):**
- Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4

**Group C (Testing/Polish):**
- Tasks 7.1, 7.2, 7.3

### Issue #72 (Meta - Overhaul CLI)
- All phases contribute to this
- Phase 3-4 specifically replace CLI with TUI
- Phase 6 provides migration path

## Notes for Future Claude Sessions
1. Check task status markers before starting work
2. Update status markers after completing tasks
3. Tasks marked [PARALLEL] can be assigned to subagents
4. Dependencies are noted with [DEPENDS: x.x]
5. This plan assumes Textual now, Flet later architecture
6. Core business logic must remain UI-agnostic

## Phase 2 Context (For LLMs Starting Fresh)
### What's Already Built (Phase 1)
- **FTS5 search**: Full-text search with BM25 ranking (`prt_src/core/search_index/`)
- **Contact cache**: LRU cache with prefix trie (`prt_src/core/search_cache/`)
- **Unified Search API**: Integrated search with error handling (`prt_src/core/search_unified.py`)
- **Core operations**: UI-agnostic business logic (`prt_src/core/`)

### Architecture Notes
- **Single-threaded currently**: No async/threading yet, but Textual may introduce it
- **Single DB session**: `self.db.session` - will need connection pooling if concurrent
- **Logging configured**: Use `from prt_src.logging_config import get_logger`
- **Pre-commit hooks**: `ruff` and `black` run automatically on commit

### Phase 2 Tips
- Task 2.1 (Autocomplete): Can leverage existing prefix trie from ContactSearchCache
- Task 2.2 (Pagination): Must handle 5000+ contacts efficiently
- Task 2.3 (Selection): Consider thread-safety if Textual adds concurrency
- Task 2.4 (Validation): Follow established error handling patterns

## Phase 3 Context (For LLMs Starting Fresh)
### What's Already Built (Phase 1-2)
- **Phase 1:** FTS5 search, contact cache, unified search API ‚úÖ
- **Phase 2:** Autocomplete, Pagination, Selection, Validation systems ‚úÖ
- **Core operations:** UI-agnostic business logic ready

### Design Decisions Made
- **Navigation:** jkl movement, ESC for mode switching, single-key actions
- **"You" contact:** Auto-created on first run with optional name prompt
- **Backup/Restore:** Non-destructive with auto-backup creation
- **Export:** Simple keybinding approach (e‚Üíc/v/j)
- **See:** `/docs/Phase3_Design_Decisions.md` for complete UI specifications

### TDD Approach for Phase 3
1. Write failing widget test in `tests/test_tui_*.py`
2. Implement widget in `prt_src/tui/widgets/`
3. Make tests pass
4. Add integration tests for Phase 2 component usage
5. Performance test with 5000+ items

### Key Integration Points
- Widgets MUST use Phase 2 components (don't reinvent)
- All business logic stays in core layer
- Textual only handles presentation
- Mode management is centralized in ModeAwareWidget base class
