/feature Enhance download_library_src to list what is in the EXTERNAL_DOCS library: An option to the download_library_src.sh script should be --list, which should output the list of things that should be downloaded, and should output a list of what is already downloaded in the EXTERNAL_DOCS directory, and comparing those two lists, then output a list of things that have not been downloaded but should be, and a list of the things that are in the EXTERNAL_DOCS directory that are not in the list of things to download in download_library.src.
