/find_plan_file ## Report

I've successfully created a comprehensive feature plan for enhancing the `download_library_src.sh` script with a `--list` option. Here's what I've done:

**Feature Plan Created:**
- **File location**: `specs/feature_download_library_src_list_command.md`

**Key Planning Elements:**

1. **Feature Description**: Added `--list` flag to display comprehensive inventory of external documentation libraries
   - Shows what should be downloaded (defined in script)
   - Shows what is already downloaded (in EXTERNAL_DOCS)
   - Compares lists to show missing and unlisted libraries

2. **Implementation Strategy**: Organized into 9 step-by-step tasks covering:
   - Argument parsing with `--list`, `--help` flags
   - Library definition extraction from the script itself
   - EXTERNAL_DOCS directory scanning
   - Comparison logic to categorize libraries (Available/Missing/Unlisted)
   - Display formatting with visual indicators (✅, ❌, ⚠️)
   - Integration and testing

3. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive edge cases including:
   - Empty/missing EXTERNAL_DOCS directory
   - Hidden files and `.DS_Store` filtering
   - All libraries downloaded vs. none downloaded
   - Unlisted directories detection
   - Backward compatibility (script still clones normally without `--list`)

4. **Validation Commands**: 10 specific test scenarios to verify:
   - Help display
   - Inventory reporting in various states
   - Normal clone operation still works
   - Proper exit codes and error handling

The plan follows existing PRT patterns, maintains backward compatibility, and provides clear acceptance criteria for successful implementation.
