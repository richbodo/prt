# Personal Relationship Tool (PRT) - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Personal Relationship Tool (PRT) is a privacy-first, client-side-encrypted contact database designed to support mental health through intentional relationship management. Unlike traditional social networks that commoditize personal data, PRT focuses on helping users maintain meaningful connections through relationship-centric organization and private note-taking.

## Problem Statement

Current contact management and social networking tools fail to support healthy relationship maintenance:

- **Memory Support Gap**: Existing contact databases don't efficiently help users map names to faces or visualize relationship groups
- **Privacy Concerns**: Personal relationship data is exposed to corporations and algorithms that monetize attention
- **Poor UX for Connection-Finding**: Users struggle to identify the right person for specific types of conversations or support
- **Algorithm-Driven Distraction**: Feeds and notifications harm focus and authentic connection

## Vision

Create a cascade of positive mental health effects by providing a tool that helps individuals maintain and strengthen their personal relationships while keeping their data completely private and under their control.

## Target Users

**Primary**: Remote tech workers in decentralized/privacy-focused communities
**Secondary**: Individuals seeking better relationship management without social media dependency

## Core Value Propositions

1. **Privacy-First Design**: Client-side encryption ensures relationship data remains completely private
2. **Relationship-Centric Organization**: Search and organize by relationship qualities, not just contact information
3. **Mental Health Focus**: Designed to reduce anxiety and support healthy connection patterns
4. **Memory Support**: Visual relationship mapping and quick mobile access for names/faces
5. **Export Flexibility**: Ability to selectively share data with other systems when desired
