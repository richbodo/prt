Personal Relationship Toolkit is a privacy-first client-side encrypted database designed to support mental health through intentional relationship management.

Started ideating on this here: http://richbodo.pbworks.com/w/page/160555728/Personal%20Social%20Network%20Health

I had a few AIs convert those notes to PRDs, then synthesized an MVP PRD: [PRD/prt_prd_mvp.md](PRD/prt_prd_mvp.md) for the consolidated requirements.
